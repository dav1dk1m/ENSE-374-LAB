## [LAB 3 Info](https://adamtilson.github.io/labs/ense-374/lab-3/)

Introduce Bootstrap CSS library, a library made by twitter, which modernizes our pages by extends our custom CSS to provide pre made layout, styles and components.

## Lab Assignment

Your task is to add Bootstrap and Custom CSS to your HTML files from last lab to match this style. You may need to add to or change your HTML and/or custom CSS to make it look exactly correct.

Recommended approach

- Look at the pictures to identify elements
- Use the Bootstrap documentation to find appropriate elements
- Add the required Bootstrap libraries from the CDN links
- Combine the appropriate Bootstrap HTML to make it look right (containers, classes, samples, etc.) with your HTML elements from last week, making changes as needed
- Add custom CSS to account for anything that does not look right. You can also try attaching the Bootstrap classes for adding padding.
