    <h1> CHAPTER I </h1>

    <h2> JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL </h2>

    <em> (Kept in shorthand.) </em>

    <p> <em> 3 May. Bistritz. </em>â€”Left Munich at 8:35 P. M., on 1st May, arriving at Vienna early next morning; should
        have arrived at 6:46, but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
        got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets.
        I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as
        possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of
        splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of
        Turkish rule. </p>
