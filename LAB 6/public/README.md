## [LAB 5 Info](https://adamtilson.github.io/labs/ense-374/lab-5/)

## Objective

This lab introduces jQuery, a JavaScript library which makes writing JavaScript code, particularly involving DOM operations, much faster. In particular it handles things like DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling and animations. Additionally, jQuery acts as an introduction to JavaScript libraries, of which many exist, so that you can understand the process of finding, integrating and using a JavaScript library.
