## Lab Assignment

For the lab project, we are going to be making a multi-user to-do list application.

### Recommended approach:

- Start by implementing the HTML only version 
    - How many pages are there? What are their names?
    - Look at the pictures and identify potential HTML elements
    - Is there one form? Multiple forms?
- Next implement the custom CSS
    - Which elements have changed due to custom CSS?
    - How might you implement this change?

### Submission:

- This lab will be demoed by interview either in the week of 9/14 or 9/21.


### Frequently asked questions:

How do I add default text to the text inputs?

- Try the “Placeholder” HTML attribute

Does the form need any functionality?

- Not yet. We just need the layout and basic styling for now.
